This github repo provides some simple codes for implementation of a ngram language model, using the Brothes Karamazov book. 
The main problem which this model has been successful to handle and makes it different from the custom ngram models is that it is capable of generating the sentences such that each sentence is started with the last word in the previously generated sentence.
